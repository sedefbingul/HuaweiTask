from department d
inner join Students s
on d.departmentID = s.departmentID

-- Description: inner joÄ±n returns only matching records, here we are getting only students with valid matching departmentID. DepartmentID is a connecting field(column) that helps to build the relationship between this table.

-- 2. FULL OUTER JOIN

from department d
FULL OUTER JOIN Students s
on d.departmentID = s.departmentID
